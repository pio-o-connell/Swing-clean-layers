Got it — I’ll remember that we’re at the point where we’ve mapped all your existing Swing/DB code into a layered architecture with:

domain (Company, Item, history, User)

repository (Databases → CompanyRepository, BackupRepository, RestoreRepository, Serialized/FileStateRepository)

service (InventoryService, BackupService, RestoreService, ReportService)

controller (InventoryController, BackupController, RestoreController, ReportController)

ui.swing (Mainframe, dialogs, etc.)

ui.servlet (WarehouseServlet, BackupServlet, etc.)

infrastructure (manual DI / ApplicationBootstrap / ConnectionFactory)

And we’ve designed the bootstrap wiring: repositories → services → controllers → UI/Servlet.

We’re ready to start refactoring one class at a time into this structure.

I’ll remember this exact point for when you continue.
