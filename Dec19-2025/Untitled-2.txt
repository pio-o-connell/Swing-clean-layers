so we need to redesign the front end to match the dtabase 



everything is working as expected, 

I want to be able to add a new transaction to the history

 so to do so
 1, In the "New Transaction To Add: area " i.r. detailsPanel WEST, I wish to add another label  and edit field called Company Name
 It will contain the current slected Company in the "Company N?ame" list

 Clicking the Add Tx button will add the new trabsaction to the history list, it will also update the database


  setBorder(BorderFactory.createTitledBorder("New Transaction/Item To Add:"));
        	// JLabel transactionLabel = new JLabel("Transaction");
        JLabel nameLabel = new JLabel("Company Name: ");
        JLabel txCompanyNameLabel = new JLabel("Company Name (Tx): ");
        JLabel currentCompanyLabel = new JLabel("Current Company: ");
        JLabel itemNameLabel = new JLabel("Item Name: ");
        JLabel providerNameLabel = new JLabel("Provider Name: ");
        JLabel quantityLabel = new JLabel("Quantity: ");
        JLabel locationLabel = new JLabel("Location: ");
        JLabel deliveryLabel = new JLabel("Date: ");
