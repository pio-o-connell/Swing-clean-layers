OK FOR THE database class we need to write a new function init() that reads the database into memeory



 It will be called from maindriver.java class first checking Itf it exists, so the way it works

 check if database exists, if it does poplate the databse db.init()

 if it doesnt generate test data 	db.setup(con,Company);

 So thats each table mapped to memory: 
 siniliar to db.setup() finction
